In a forked repository, I have write access and can push changes, but contributions are made and vetted as pull requests. In a team setting, it's a great way to work together and only merge code when it is spot-on, bug-free!",

Meals are a key part of everyone's day, but, more importantly they are a way that people interact socially and bond. From personal experience with my sister and nephew, I saw how isolating it could be to be unable to eat the same foods as everyone else. I came up with AllergyFreeMeals so that you could create and source delicious meals from an allergy-conscious community. It even has 'search-by-allergen' functionality for filtering recipes that meet your specific needs. It was great to use coding skills and leverage jQuery, AJAX and ActiveModelSerializers all for a greater purpose of this application.
