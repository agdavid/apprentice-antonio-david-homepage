Create a homepage. It can be about anything. Just give us a sense of you and what you like!
Create a FAQ page about yourself and link to it. We'd like to route to /answers.
Create a simple scaffold to add content to your FAQ page and answer the following questions:
What is your name?
What is your email?
What is your Github url?
What is your LinkedIn url?
Can you tell us why we asked you to fork this repo instead of clone it?
Tell us about your favorite coding project of all time? What was great about it?
*You can password protect this page if you like. Just remember to share the password with us.
Deploy the site to Heroku.
Send your Heroku app link to apprentice@standardco.de. We will reply to your email with one more challenge!
